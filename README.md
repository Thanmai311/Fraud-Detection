# Fraud Detection Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Fraud detection is a critical problem in banking and finance.  
This system uses data analysis and machine learning models to identify suspicious transactions and reduce fraud risk.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook


## Project Structure

The Fraud-Detection project is organized for clarity and ease of use. The data/ folder contains dataset files, while notebooks/ holds Jupyter notebooks for analysis and experimentation. All reusable code resides in src/, and trained models are saved in models/. The requirements.txt lists all dependencies, and README.md provides an overview, setup instructions, and usage details. This structure keeps the project clean, modular, and easy to navigate.


## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains transaction-related information.
- Each transaction is labeled as:
  - `0` → Legitimate
  - `1` → Fraud
